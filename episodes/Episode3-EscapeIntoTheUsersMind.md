## Theory of Mind \- Escape your own perspective, and feel the users' instead

**Learning objectives**

* Learner will know the definition of a “user” in UX, and name ways a user’s context will differ from their own as the designer/developer  
* Given an example interface that we have made them familiar with, user will be able to recognize and label the pieces of the interface that are familiar and unfamiliar **to themselves**.  
* Given an example interface that we have made them familiar with, user will be able to recognize and label the pieces of the interface that are familiar and unfamiliar **to a naive user**.

**Episode outline**

* Talk over (actually do the experiment\!) cup hiding the ball experiment that shows when children learn that not everyone has the same context  
* How does this apply to design  
  * Language and jargon  
  * Workflows \- you have been involved in building the tool, you know the ins and outs of how it works. Your users do not have that context  
  * You may assume ease of use based on your own domain knowledge / familiarity, but not all users will have that
