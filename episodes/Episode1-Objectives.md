# Target Audience

A developer who’s building science tools, without the support of a designer. If they build software without thinking about the design, the software will be hard to use, taking away from the utility of the tool. This may lead to continual requests for changes after launch that could have been avoided if the design had been considered up front. A background in design can empower developers to build tools that are more effective for scientists. 

# List of prerequisite knowledge

* Basic diagramming (ie: drawing shapes with Powerpoint, miro board, Figma, MS Paint, Pen & Paper, Excalidraw)

# Lesson Learning Objectives

The skills learned will be applicable to improving existing software and creating something new. After following this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. Learner will leave with basic literacy in evaluating a design  
   1. When presented with a software example, learner will be able to identify areas causing higher cognitive load (things aren’t aligned, too many fonts/sizes, not enough space, illogical item groupings)  
   2. When presented with a software example, learner will be able to call out what ‘stands out first, second, and third’ on the page in an order similar to the instructer’s own perception.  
2. Learner will be able to create design hierarchy  
   1. When given a list of software functions, ranked by importance, learner will be able to create a layout using shapes and text that establishes a hierarchy  
   2. When given a basic layout, learner will be able to add elements to create clutter and remove elements to fix “clutter”  
3. When given a list of field names, learner will be able to correctly identify when use of technical language (Acrynoms, database speak, high level vocab) is helpful or harmful  
   1. defining language that may be unfamilliar to others  
   2. using simpler language when possible  
4. Learner will be able to recite 3 key best practices of layout design
