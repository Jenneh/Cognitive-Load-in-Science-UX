## Simplicity \- Everything added subtracts

### Learning objectives

Given a self-chosen example interface, the learner will be able to identify one aspect to deemphasize. 

Given an example interface, learner will be able to create a quick 'whiteout' mockup in Figma.

1. #### Demonstrate the problem: count the bunnies \- It's easier to count the bunnies when there's no clutter

Try to count the bunnies in this photo as quickly as you can.

Now, try to count the bunnies as fast as possible again…

Notice that it was much harder to find the (smaller) bunnies when there was more clutter? It's the classic "Where's Waldo" experience. High clutter increases your cognitive load (because you have to work harder to filter-out non-bunnies) and slows down your performance.

Interfaces work the same way. Now imagine the bunnies are crucial pieces of information, or buttons to perform tasks.

2. #### Context: Deleting is opposite of scientific thinking.

Deleting is opposite of scientific thinking. In science education, students are encouraged to write long, wordy, jargon filled papers. Key points and take-aways are lost among the noise. A common tactic scientists use to highlight key points is **over-emphasizing**. If their paper is a crowded room, they try to dress their hypothesis in bright yellow. But there are 100 other people dressed in orange and purple. So then they give their hypothesis a hat. 

Let’s focus on the skill of deleting and de-emphasizing.

"In the spring of my senior year at Lisbon High—1966, this would have been—I got a scribbled comment that changed the way I rewrote my fiction once and forever. Jotted below the machine-generated signature of the editor was this mot: "Not bad, but PUFFY. You need to revise for length. Formula: 2nd Draft \= 1st Draft – 10%. Good luck." — Stephen King

3. #### Tactics: 

   * **Remove** \- There is usually text / steps in a workflow / visual clutter that can be entirely deleted  
   * **Hide until relevan**t \- Software is interactive. This is powerful because it allows us to share information as it becomes relevant to the user. Hide information until the user:   
     * **needs it:** show it as the user arrives at the relevant part of the workflow  
     * **summons it:** show it when the user requests the information. This can be done with hover text or popups.  
   * **Simplify** \- can something condensed without losing the important content? What are the fewest words you can use to describe a concept? What are the fewest steps needed to complete a task?

   Often people worry that important information will be lost so they keep everything in. Remember If you let something go and it comes back then its meant to be

## Exercise \#2: Throw something away on your desk

## Exercise \#3: Delete from their own software (because they know it)
