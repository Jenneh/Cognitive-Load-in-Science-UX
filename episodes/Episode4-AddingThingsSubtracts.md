## Simplicity \- Everything added subtracts

### Learning objectives

Given a self-chosen example interface, the learner will be able to identify one aspect to deemphasize. 

Given an example interface, learner will be able to create a quick 'whiteout' mockup in Figma.

### Demonstrate the problem

#### Example 1: count the bunnies

Try to count the bunnies in this photo as quickly as you can.

Now, try to count the bunnies as fast as possible again…

Notice that it was much harder to find the (smaller) bunnies when there was more clutter? It's the classic "Where's Waldo" experience. High clutter increases your cognitive load (because you have to work harder to filter-out non-bunnies) and slows down your performance.

Interfaces work the same way. Now imagine the bunnies are crucial pieces of information, or buttons to perform tasks. 

It's easier to complete the core task—counting the bunnies—when there's no clutter

2. #### Why unessesary complexity is such a problem in science 

In science education, deleting is opposite of scientific thinking. Students are encouraged to write long, wordy, jargon filled papers. Often professors have high word count requirements for papers. Many (most!) professionally published papers are similarly unessecarily complex. The culture becomes about peacocking intellegence rather than conveying the point.

The problem - key take-aways become lost among the noise. So a commonly used tactic is **over-emphasizing**. Papers are a crowded room so scientists dress their hypothesis in bright yellow. But there are 100 other people dressed in orange and purple. So then they give their hypothesis a hat. The graphic design equivelant - The hypothesis is bolded, but other things are bolded, so then it gets underlines too.

If science education had low word count requirements it might start to train writing consisely. Take it from Stephen King: 
"I got a scribbled comment that changed the way I rewrote my fiction once and forever. Jotted below the machine-generated signature of the editor was this note: "Not bad, but PUFFY. You need to revise for length. Formula: 2nd Draft \= 1st Draft – 10%. Good luck."

3. #### Tactics 

Let’s focus on the skill of deleting and de-emphasizing.

   * **Remove** \- There is usually text / steps in a workflow / visual clutter that can be entirely deleted  
   * **Hide until relevant** \- Software is interactive. This is powerful because it allows us to share information as it becomes relevant to the user. Hide information until the user:  
     * **needs it:** show it as the user arrives at the relevant part of the workflow  
     * **summons it:** show it when the user requests the information. This can be done with hover text or popups.  
   * **Simplify** \- can something condensed without losing the important content? Are there two things that can be combined into one? What are the fewest words you can use to describe a concept? What are the fewest steps needed to complete a task?

   People worry that important information will be lost so they keep everything. If you let something go and it comes back then its meant to be. Relevant information has a way of sticking around ;) 


## Exercise: Delete from their own work (because they know it)
Pick a piece of software you work on (or a slide deck you've written). It can be a website you've built, a Jupyter Notebook you've written, or something else. If you can't think of any, use this website: 


##remove this?
