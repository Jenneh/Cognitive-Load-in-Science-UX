## Final Project \- Designing list view from scratch

**Learning objectives**

* How to hack together a new design concept  
* Use similar elements for familiarity lowers load (knowing what something does)

**Episode outline**

- Design as a skill

**Activity ideas:**

- Product result table (list of stuff you need to review)  
  - List views are super common  
  - Learners can use their own collection of data to show in the list view  
  - We can also give an example with   
- Or an advanced search page (that searches a database of exoplanets)

# Designing Exercises

FIXME use the space below to draft exercises to help you assess learners’ progress towards the objectives you defined for your episode.

Exersises here: [https://app.mural.co/t/stsciinternal7446/m/stsciinternal7446/1761226323984/98fa21d3961fe8de7608fc9b04147472ff56cb4d](https://app.mural.co/t/stsciinternal7446/m/stsciinternal7446/1761226323984/98fa21d3961fe8de7608fc9b04147472ff56cb4d)

## Minimal fix

* Count the bunnies, be good (declutter) or evil (add clutter)  
* Level 2: Find the graph

## True false (good for novice)

* When building tools for Science, it is best practice to include every detail of a scientific concept

* When building tools for Science, it is best practice to use always use formal language and advanced vocabulary

## Fill-in-the blank (good for novice)

* The quickest way to lower cognitive load of a design is to\_\_\_\_ (delete something uncessary)

**Fix a slightly broken design** (good for novice)

* Give a layout with text, where the headings and text are not aligned. Have them fix the alignment (simple grid)

* Give a layout with text where all the text is the same size and weight. ask them to add hirearchy

### **Examples before exercises**

FIXME use this space to make some notes about examples/narrative you could use to demonstrate the skills/teach the knowledge that learners will need to complete the exercise(s) you designed above.
